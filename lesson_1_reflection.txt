How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	it pointed out the bug and made it easier to spot

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	makes you faster in spotting errors, allows you access to older builds

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

	pros - you chose when you save, more meaningful saves
	cons - if unexpected system failure occurs, data can be lost

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	because some files are dependent on others versus something simple like google
	docs is meant for simple documents

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to find the log id number of the change. git diff to see specific changes
	between files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because older versions will be saved in the repository if changes occur and need to be reverted

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Programming and version control among team enviroments
